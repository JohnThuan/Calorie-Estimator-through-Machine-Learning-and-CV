HOW TO ADD SCREENSHOTS TO YOUR README
======================================

1. Take screenshots of your app:
   - Open your app on your iPhone
   - Take screenshots of each screen (Home, Camera, Results, History, Baseline)
   - Save them to your computer

2. Rename your screenshots to match these names:
   - home-screen.png (or .jpg)
   - camera-screen.png
   - results-screen.png
   - history-screen.png
   - baseline-screen.png

3. Place them in this "screenshots" folder

4. Optional: Add training graphs
   - training-accuracy.png (from TensorBoard or training logs)
   - training-loss.png
   - architecture-diagram.png (you can create this with draw.io or PowerPoint)

5. Commit and push:
   git add screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add screenshots"
   git push

The images will automatically appear in your README.md!

TIPS:
- Use PNG format for better quality
- Keep image file sizes reasonable (under 1MB each)
- Make sure screenshots show the app clearly
- You can use iPhone's screenshot feature (Volume Up + Power button)
